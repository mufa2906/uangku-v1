## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables
- [ ] DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
- [ ] BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key_for_authentication
- [ ] GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id (optional)
- [ ] GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret (optional)
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

### Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- [ ] BetterAuth tables with _uangku_ prefix created:
  - [ ] _uangku_users
  - [ ] _uangku_accounts
  - [ ] _uangku_sessions
  - [ ] _uangku_verification_tokens
- [ ] Proper database permissions for application user

### Domain Configuration
- [ ] Custom domain (not vercel.app) for production deployment
- [ ] HTTPS certificate for secure connections

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare for Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mufa2906/uangku-v1.git
cd uangku-v1

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Set environment variables (see above)
# Create .env.local file with required variables

# Run build
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
- Push to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Set required environment variables in deployment platform
- Configure custom domain and HTTPS
- Deploy the built application

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Accessibility features work correctly in production
- [ ] Offline functionality with IndexedDB works in real-world conditions
- [ ] Authentication system functions properly with BetterAuth
- [ ] Database operations work correctly with _uangku_ prefixed tables
- [ ] All API routes respond correctly

## Success Metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Build Failures
- **Issue**: Module resolution errors or TypeScript compilation errors
- **Solution**: Run `npm ci` to reinstall dependencies with exact versions

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
- **Issue**: Authentication or data access failures
- **Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL and database permissions

#### 3. Offline Functionality Issues
- **Issue**: Transactions not saving or syncing properly
- **Solution**: Check browser console for IndexedDB errors and clear cache

#### 4. Authentication Issues
- **Issue**: Sign in/sign up failures
- **Solution**: Verify BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and database schema
