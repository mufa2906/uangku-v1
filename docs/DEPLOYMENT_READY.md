- ✅ Proper database schema with prefixed tables

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Push to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Set required environment variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
     - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for BetterAuth sessions
     - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID (optional)
     - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret (optional)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Public URL of your application

2. **Configure Domain**:
   - Set up custom domain (not vercel.app for production)
   - Configure HTTPS certificate

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL database is properly configured
   - Run database migrations to create BetterAuth tables
   - Verify database permissions

4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check IndexedDB performance with real-world usage
   - Monitor authentication performance
   - Review accessibility feedback from users
