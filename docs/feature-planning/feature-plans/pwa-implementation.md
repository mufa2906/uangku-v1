# PWA Implementation (Offline & Push Notifications)

## Status
IMPLEMENTED - [Date] - Successfully implemented PWA functionality with offline capabilities and push notifications

## Overview
Successfully implemented Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality and offline capabilities for Uangku. The implementation enables users to install the app, receive push notifications, and create transactions even when offline. The feature is currently deployed and available in the application.

## User Stories (if applicable)
- As a user, I want to install Uangku on my device home screen for native-like experience
- As a user, I want to receive push notifications for bill reminders and budget warnings
- As a user, I want to create transactions even when I don't have internet connection
- As a user, I want my offline transactions to automatically sync when connectivity is restored
- As a user, I want to be aware of my online/offline status while using the app
- As a user, I want to have a native-like experience when using Uangku

## Requirements (if applicable)
- PWA installation capability with proper web app manifest
- Offline functionality allowing transaction creation without internet
- Push notification system for bill reminders and budget warnings
- Background sync of offline transactions when online
- Connection status awareness and appropriate UI feedback
- Service worker for caching and offline support
- Proper error handling for network issues
- Data persistence during offline periods

## Technical Implementation
- Created PWA infrastructure with service worker (public/sw.js) for caching and offline support
- Implemented offline transaction storage using localStorage with sync status tracking
- Created PWA context (PWAContext.tsx) for centralized state management of online/offline status
- Developed offline sync hook (useOfflineSync.ts) for automatic sync when connectivity restored
- Added dedicated offline transaction page (src/app/offline/page.tsx) for offline functionality
- Implemented push notification service (push-notification-service.ts) for subscription management
- Created offline transaction components (OfflineTransactionForm.tsx, OfflineTransactionList.tsx)
- Added notification API endpoints for bill reminders and budget warnings
- Enhanced AI transaction parsing for proper amount detection in offline mode

## Database Schema (if applicable)
N/A - Uses localStorage for offline transaction storage with server sync capability

## API Endpoints (if applicable)
- `GET /api/offline-transactions` - Handle offline transaction sync
- `POST /api/offline-transactions` - Create offline transactions with sync capability
- `GET /api/push-subscriptions` - Get user push notification subscriptions
- `POST /api/push-subscriptions` - Add new push notification subscription
- `DELETE /api/push-subscriptions` - Remove push notification subscription
- `POST /api/notifications/bill-reminder` - Send bill reminder notifications
- `POST /api/notifications/budget-warning` - Send budget warning notifications

## Implementation Status

## UI/UX Implementation (if applicable)
- Dedicated offline transaction page with clear online/offline status indicators
- Visual feedback when creating transactions while offline
- Sync status notifications showing pending and synced transactions
- Connection status alerts in the UI to inform users of connectivity changes
- Install prompt for PWA functionality with clear user guidance
- Settings page integration for PWA and push notification preferences
- Offline-friendly UI that gracefully degrades when connection is lost
- Clear user feedback during sync operations

## Type Definitions (if applicable)
N/A

## Current Implementation Details (if applicable)
- Service worker (`public/sw.js`) handles caching with cache-first strategy for static assets
- Offline storage system (`src/lib/offline-storage.ts`) stores transactions with sync status
- PWA context (`src/contexts/PWAContext.tsx`) manages online/offline state across the app
- Offline sync hook (`src/hooks/useOfflineSync.ts`) handles automatic sync when online
- Dedicated offline page (`src/app/offline/page.tsx`) for creating transactions when offline
- Push notifications service manages subscription lifecycle and notification delivery
- Transaction NLP improvements ensure proper amount extraction even in offline mode
- Background sync capability with conflict resolution for duplicate transactions

## Known Issues (if applicable)
- iOS Safari has limited PWA capabilities compared to other browsers
- Background sync may be limited by browser policies
- Large batches of offline transactions may take time to sync when online

## Future Enhancements
- IndexedDB integration for better offline storage capacity
- Enhanced offline dashboards with cached insights
- Advanced push notification scenarios and scheduling
- Improved background sync with conflict resolution
- Cross-device sync for multi-device users
- Enhanced offline analytics and reporting
