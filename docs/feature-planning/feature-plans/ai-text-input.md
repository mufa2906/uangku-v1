# AI-Powered Transaction Entry

## Status
IMPLEMENTED - [Date] - Successfully implemented AI functionality for natural language transaction entry

## Overview
Successfully implemented AI functionality to allow users to input transactions using natural language (e.g., "ate nasi padang for 35000"). The feature is currently deployed and available in the transaction creation form.

## User Stories (if applicable)
- As a user, I want to type natural language to create transactions (e.g., "bought coffee 25000")
- As a user, I want the app to automatically extract amount, category, and description
- As a user, I want to confirm or edit the extracted information before saving
- As a user, I want the AI to learn my spending patterns over time

## Requirements (if applicable)
- Natural language processing for transaction input
- Ability to extract amount, category, and description from text
- Suggestion system for categories based on transaction text
- Confirmation step before saving extracted data
- Support for Indonesian language spending descriptions

## Technical Implementation
- Created NLP parser to extract amount, description, and potential category using regex patterns
- Implemented TransactionLearning system to improve categorization over time
- Created toggle button in transaction form to switch to AI input mode
- Integrated AI parsing with existing transaction form workflow
- Added pattern recognition and learning for improved categorization

## Database Schema (if applicable)
N/A

## API Endpoints (if applicable)
N/A

## Implementation Status
- [x] User can enter natural language transaction descriptions
- [x] System correctly parses amount from the text
- [x] System suggests appropriate category based on description
- [x] User can confirm or edit extracted information
- [x] Transaction is created with the parsed information
- [x] System handles common Indonesian spending patterns
- [x] Error handling when text cannot be parsed
- [x] Transaction pattern learning system for improved suggestions

## UI/UX Implementation (if applicable)
- Added toggle button in transaction form to switch to AI input mode
- Created dedicated AI transaction input component with text field
- Show extracted information in a clear, confirmable format in main form
- Allow easy editing of extracted data in standard form fields
- Provide feedback when AI cannot parse the text
- Support both Bahasa Indonesia and English inputs

## Type Definitions (if applicable)
N/A

## Current Implementation Details (if applicable)
- Located in `src/components/transactions/AiTransactionInput.tsx`
- Uses custom NLP engine with regex patterns for Indonesian transaction parsing
- Integrated with TransactionLearning system for pattern storage and retrieval
- Toggle button shows/hides AI input when creating new transactions
- Parsed data populates standard transaction form fields

Common Indonesian Transaction Patterns Supported:
- "makan nasi gudeg 25000" → Category: Food, Amount: 25000, Description: nasi gudeg
- "isi pulsa 50000" → Category: Utilities, Amount: 50000, Description: pulsa
- "beli buku 125000" → Category: Shopping, Amount: 125000, Description: buku
- "makan sop sapi 23000" → Category: Food, Amount: 23000, Description: sop sapi (improved amount extraction)
- "makan nasi gudeg" → Category: Food, Description: nasi gudeg (no amount case) 
- "makan nasi sop 25000" → Category: Food, Amount: 25000, Description: nasi sop (preserved food words in description)

## Known Issues (if applicable)
N/A

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning model integration for improved parsing accuracy
- Context-aware suggestions based on time of day, location, or user habits
- Support for more complex transaction patterns and edge cases
- Enhanced learning system with better pattern recognition
