## Updated Database Schema
```ts
// In src/lib/schema.ts
export const budgets = pgTable("budgets", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  userId: varchar("user_id").notNull(), // References users.id (Clerk)
  walletId: uuid("wallet_id").notNull().references(() => wallets.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }), // Source wallet for this budget
  categoryId: uuid("category_id").references(() => categories.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }), // Optional category linkage
  name: varchar("name", { length: 100 }), // Custom budget name
  description: text("description"), // Optional description
  allocatedAmount: numeric("allocated_amount", { precision: 14, scale: 2 }).notNull(), // Amount allocated to this budget
  remainingAmount: numeric("remaining_amount", { precision: 14, scale: 2 }).notNull(), // Amount remaining in this budget
  currency: varchar("currency", { length: 3 }).notNull().default('IDR'), // Currency code
  period: pgEnum("budget_period", ["weekly", "monthly", "yearly"]).notNull(), // Budget period
  startDate: date("start_date").notNull(), // Start date of budget period
  endDate: date("end_date").notNull(), // End date of budget period
  isActive: boolean("is_active").notNull().default(true),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true }).defaultNow(),
});
```
