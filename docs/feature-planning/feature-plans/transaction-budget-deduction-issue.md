# Transaction-Budget Double Deduction Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Statement (RESOLVED)
When creating a transaction that links to both a wallet and a budget, the system was deducting the amount from both the wallet and the budget, effectively charging the user twice for the same transaction.

## Original Issue (Buggy Behavior)
- When creating a transaction that links to both a wallet and a budget
- The transaction amount was deducted from both the wallet balance AND the budget remaining amount
- This resulted in a double deduction, which was incorrect

## Root Cause Analysis
The system was designed correctly conceptually - when you spend money from a budget:
- Wallet balance should decrease (actual money spent)
- Budget remaining amount should decrease (allocated money used up)

However, the implementation was flawed in the flow:
1. Budgets are created by allocating money from a wallet (wallet balance decreases)
2. When transactions are made using that budget, money was deducted again from the wallet
3. This resulted in double-charging the user

## Corrected Understanding & Implementation
- Budgets contain money that has already been allocated from wallets
- When making a transaction against a budget, we should only deduct from the budget
- The wallet should NOT be affected when a transaction is linked to a budget
- When a transaction is NOT linked to a budget, then and only then should the wallet be affected

## Resolution & Implementation

### Changes implemented:

1. In transaction creation (POST /api/transactions):
   - If transaction is linked to a budget, only update the budget (not the wallet) 
   - If transaction is not linked to a budget, only update the wallet

2. In transaction updates (PUT /api/transactions/[id]):
   - Apply the same logic based on whether the transaction is linked to a budget

3. In transaction deletion (DELETE /api/transactions/[id]):
   - Revert based on whether the transaction was linked to a budget

## Code Implementation (RESOLVED)

The issue has been successfully resolved in `src/app/api/transactions/route.ts`:

```typescript
// In transaction creation (POST):
if (budgetId && budgetData) {
  // If transaction is linked to a budget, only update the budget
  if (type === 'income') {
    // For income, increase budget remaining amount
    await db
      .update(budgets)
      .set({
        remainingAmount: sql`${budgets.remainingAmount} + ${transactionAmount}`,
      })
      .where(eq(budgets.id, budgetId));
  } else if (type === 'expense') {
    // For expense, decrease budget remaining amount
    await db
      .update(budgets)
      .set({
        remainingAmount: sql`${budgets.remainingAmount} - ${transactionAmount}`,
      })
      .where(eq(budgets.id, budgetId));
  }
} else {
  // If transaction is not linked to a budget, only update the wallet
  if (type === 'income') {
    // For income, add to wallet
    await db
      .update(wallets)
      .set({
        balance: sql`${wallets.balance} + ${transactionAmount}`,
      })
      .where(eq(wallets.id, walletId));
  } else if (type === 'expense') {
    // For expense, subtract from wallet
    await db
      .update(wallets)
      .set({
        balance: sql`${wallets.balance} - ${transactionAmount}`,
      })
      .where(eq(wallets.id, walletId));
  }
}
```

## Resolution Status
- [x] Transaction creation properly handles wallet vs. budget updates
- [x] Transaction updates properly handle wallet vs. budget adjustments
- [x] Transaction deletion properly reverses the correct balance (wallet or budget)
- [x] No more double deductions in the system
- [x] Proper financial tracking with single money tracking

## Result
This approach ensures that money is only tracked once, either against a budget or against a wallet, but not both simultaneously. The issue has been successfully resolved and deployed.
