# Wallet-Budget Mismatch Issue

## Status
RESOLVED - [Date] - Fixed wallet-budget mismatch issue when editing transactions

## Overview
When editing a transaction that is linked to a budget, users cannot change the wallet to one that is different from the budget's source wallet. This created a poor user experience when users initially select the wrong wallet or budget combination.

## User Stories (if applicable)

## Requirements (if applicable)
- Fix the wallet-budget mismatch issue in transaction editing
- Allow users to change wallets when budgets are selected
- Provide clear feedback when budget is cleared due to wallet change
- Maintain data integrity while improving user experience

## Technical Implementation
The issue has been successfully resolved with a user-friendly approach that maintains data integrity while providing flexibility:

### For Transaction Creation/Updates (API):
- When a budget is selected, the wallet automatically matches the budget's wallet
- When a wallet is changed after budget selection, the budget is automatically cleared with a helpful notification
- Proper validation still occurs to ensure budget-wallet consistency when both are selected

### For UI Implementation (TransactionFormSheet.tsx):
- When user selects a budget, the wallet field is automatically populated with the budget's wallet
- When user changes wallet selection with a budget already selected, the budget is automatically cleared
- A clear notification message is shown: "Budget 'Budget Name' was cleared as it doesn't belong to the selected wallet."
- Toast notifications provide additional feedback for this workflow
- Users can then select an appropriate budget from their chosen wallet

## Implementation Status
- [x] Wallet-bundle mismatch validation implemented in API
- [x] User-friendly UI handling in transaction form
- [x] Auto-clearing of budget when wallet is changed to different one
- [x] Clear user notifications and feedback
- [x] Toast notifications for better UX
- [x] Maintained data integrity while improving user experience

## UI/UX Implementation (if applicable)
The resolution is implemented in `src/components/transactions/TransactionFormSheet.tsx`:

```typescript
<Select 
  value={formData.walletId} 
  onValueChange={(value) => {
    // If there's already a budget selected that doesn't belong to this wallet, auto-clear it
    if (formData.budgetId) {
      const selectedBudget = budgets.find(b => b.id === formData.budgetId);
      if (selectedBudget && selectedBudget.walletId !== value) {
        // Auto-clear the budget and show a friendly message
        setFormData(prev => ({
          ...prev,
          walletId: value,
          budgetId: '' // Clear the budget when changing to a different wallet
        }));
        const budgetName = selectedBudget.name || 'Unnamed Budget';
        setBudgetClearedMessage(`Budget "${budgetName}" was cleared as it doesn't belong to the selected wallet.`);
        setTimeout(() => setBudgetClearedMessage(null), 4000);
        
        // Show toast notification
        addToast(toast.info(
          'Budget Selection Cleared',
          `"${budgetName}" was removed because it doesn't belong to the selected wallet.`,
          4000
        ));
      } else {
        setFormData(prev => ({
          ...prev,
          walletId: value
        }));
      }
    } else {
      setFormData(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        walletId: value
      }));
    }
  }}

## Current Implementation Details (if applicable)
Result: Users can now seamlessly switch between wallets and budgets with appropriate guidance and automatic handling. When a user selects a budget, the appropriate wallet is automatically selected. When a user changes wallets, the budget selection is cleared with a helpful message, allowing them to choose an appropriate budget for the new wallet. This resolves the original user experience issue while maintaining data integrity.

## Known Issues (if applicable)
Original Issue (Limiting Behavior):
- When creating/updating a transaction, if a budget is selected, it must be linked to the currently selected wallet
- If a user selects Budget A (linked to Wallet A) and then switches to Wallet B, the system threw a "Budget wallet mismatch" error
- This prevented users from easily correcting mistakes or changing their wallet choice after selecting a budget
