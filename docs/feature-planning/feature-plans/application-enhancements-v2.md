# Application Enhancements V2

## Status
PENDING - Planned enhancements for Uangku application

## Overview
This document outlines several key enhancements requested to improve the user experience of the Uangku application. These improvements focus on dashboard UI/UX enhancements, contrast improvements for outdoor use, budget-based filtering, prioritizing budget over wallet, offline functionality improvements, and enhanced analytics with period-based insights.

## Issues to Address

### 1. Budget Summary in Dashboard Missing Budget Names
**Problem**: The budget summary in dashboard doesn't show the name of the budget, making it difficult for users to quickly identify which budget they're looking at.

**Requirements**:
- Display budget name in dashboard budget summary cards
- Maintain visual hierarchy and readability while adding budget names
- Ensure budget display is consistent across all parts of the app

### 2. Low Color Contrast for Outdoor Use
**Problem**: The color scheme used in the app lacks sufficient contrast, making it difficult to see when using the app outdoors.

**Requirements**:
- Improve color contrast ratios for better readability in bright conditions
- Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines for text and UI elements
- Ensure both light and dark modes have improved contrast
- Test readability under various lighting conditions
- Maintain visual appeal while improving contrast

### 3. Filter Transactions by Budget Instead of Income/Expense
**Problem**: Current filtering system only allows filtering by income/expense, but users want to filter by budget to see transactions for specific budgets.

**Requirements**:
- Add budget-based filtering option in transactions page
- Implement multi-option filtering system (income/expense, budget, time period, etc.)
- Allow users to filter by multiple budgets simultaneously
- Provide clear UI for budget selection in filter interface

### 4. Budget-Centric Default Page Instead of Wallet
**Problem**: Currently the default view is wallet-focused, but users manage budgets more frequently than wallets.

**Requirements**:
- Change default view from wallet-centric to budget-centric
- Update dashboard to focus primarily on budget information
- Maintain quick access to wallet information
- Ensure navigation hierarchy reflects the importance of budget management
- Update navigation components to prioritize budget access

### 5. Offline Functionality Issues
**Problem**: Current offline functionality doesn't work properly. Need to determine if this is due to database connections, Clerk authentication, or other factors.

**Requirements**:
- Identify root causes preventing offline functionality from working
- Determine if issues are related to database connections, Clerk authentication, or other dependencies
- Implement proper offline-first architecture using IndexedDB for reliable storage
- Ensure offline transactions can be created and stored without requiring network connectivity
- Maintain sync functionality after connectivity is restored
- Test offline functionality in various network conditions

### 6. Replace Recent Transactions with Period-Based Analytics
**Problem**: Dashboard shows recent transactions but users want more analytical insights with customizable time periods.

**Requirements**:
- Remove recent transactions section from dashboard
- Implement period-based analytics with date range selection
- Add time period options: daily, weekly, monthly, custom range
- Include insights such as:
  - Highest transactions by category and amount
  - Detailed transaction notes for high-value transactions
  - Lowest transactions for analysis
  - Spending trends and patterns
  - Budget vs. actual spending comparison
  - Category-based spending analysis
- Provide visualization for analytical data
- Enable comparison between different periods

## Technical Implementation

- Update API endpoints to support budget-based filtering
- Modify transaction query logic to include budget filters
- Create UI component for budget selection in filtering interface

### Budget-Centric Default Page Implementation
- Reorganize navigation hierarchy to prioritize budget features
- Update dashboard to focus on budget information
- Create budget-centric overview page as default landing point
- Ensure smooth transition from current wallet-centric approach

### Offline Functionality Improvements
- Identify dependencies that prevent offline usage
- Implement proper IndexedDB storage for offline transactions
- Ensure Clerk authentication can work in offline scenarios
- Create offline-first architecture with proper sync strategies
- Implement service worker improvements to handle offline scenarios

### Period-Based Analytics Implementation
- Remove recent transactions section from dashboard
- Create analytics component with date range selection
- Implement analytical calculations for:
  - Highest/lowest transactions
  - Category-based spending
  - Trend analysis
  - Budget comparisons
- Add visualization components for analytical data
- Create API endpoints that support analytical queries with date ranges

## Database Schema (if applicable)
