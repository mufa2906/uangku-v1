## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Worker Enhancements
The service worker (`public/sw.js`) now includes:
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache-first for static assets, network-first for API calls
- **Offline Fallback**: Dedicated offline page for disconnected access
- **Push Notification Support**: Handling for push events and notification clicks
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization of offline transactions
- **Asset Pre-caching**: Critical application assets cached for instant loading

### Offline Transaction Storage
The offline storage system (`src/lib/offline-storage.ts`) implements:
- **Local Persistence**: IndexedDB for reliable offline transaction storage
- **Sync Status Tracking**: Tracking which transactions have been synced
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removing synced transactions from local storage
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling duplicate transaction scenarios

### Push Notification System
The push notification system (`src/services/push-notification-service.ts`) provides:
- **Subscription Management**: Handling browser push subscription lifecycle
- **Permission Handling**: Proper request and management of notification permissions
- **Notification Sending**: Reliable delivery of push notifications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network and delivery errors

### AI Transaction Parsing Improvements
The transaction NLP system (`src/lib/transaction-nlp.ts`) now:
- **Amount Extraction**: Correctly identifies amounts like "23000" instead of "230"
- **Description Cleaning**: Removes amounts from descriptions to prevent duplication
- **Pattern Recognition**: Better Indonesian transaction pattern matching
- **Category Mapping**: More accurate category assignment based on transaction patterns

## Testing & Verification
