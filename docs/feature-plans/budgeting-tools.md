# Feature Plan: Budgeting Tools

## Overview
Implement budgeting functionality allowing users to set spending limits and track their progress.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to set monthly budgets for different categories
- As a user, I want to see my spending vs. budget progress visually
- As a user, I want alerts when I'm approaching my budget limits
- As a user, I want to use different budgeting methods (50/30/20, zero-based, etc.)

## Requirements
- Allow users to set budgets per category
- Visual indicators for budget progress (e.g., progress bars, charts)
- Budget period management (monthly, weekly, etc.)
- Alert system for budget limits
- Support for different budgeting methodologies

## Technical Implementation
- Add budget table to database (userId, categoryId, budgetAmount, period, startDate, endDate)
- Create API routes for budget CRUD operations
- Update dashboard to show budget progress
- Implement notification system for budget alerts
- Create budget setting UI in categories or dedicated budget page

## Budgeting Methodologies to Support
1. **50/30/20 Rule**: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings
2. **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Income - Expenses = 0
3. **Envelope Method**: Allocate cash to different spending categories
4. **Pay Yourself First**: Automate savings before spending

## UI/UX Considerations
- Add budget setting section to category management
- Visual budget progress indicators on dashboard
- Color-coded budget status (green for under budget, red for over)
- Quick budget setting using historical spending data
- Budget summary cards showing progress

## Future Enhancements
