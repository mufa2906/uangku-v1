# Feature Plan: Logout Functionality

## Overview
Add logout capability to allow users to sign out and switch accounts.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to log out so I can switch to a different account.
- As a user, I want to be redirected to the sign-in page after logout.
- As a user, I want my session to be properly cleared after logout.

## Requirements
- Add a logout button/option in the user profile menu
- Implement Clerk's logout function
- Redirect user to sign-in page after logout
- Clear any local state/cache related to the user session

## Technical Implementation
- Use Clerk's `signOut()` function from `@clerk/nextjs`
- Add logout option to profile page or navigation menu
- Handle the redirect to sign-in page after successful logout

## UI/UX Considerations
- Place logout option in user profile menu
- Confirm logout action if needed (for sensitive applications)
- Provide visual feedback during logout process

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can see and click a logout button/link
- [ ] Clicking logout calls Clerk's signOut function
- [ ] User is redirected to sign-in page after logout
- [ ] User session is properly cleared
- [ ] User cannot access protected routes after logout

## Testing Scenarios
- Clicking logout button successfully signs user out
- User is redirected to sign-in page
- User cannot access dashboard or other protected routes after logout
- Another user can sign in after logout
