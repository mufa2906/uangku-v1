# Feature Plan: AI-Powered Transaction Entry

## Overview
Implement AI functionality to allow users to input transactions using natural language (e.g., "ate nasi padang for 35000").

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to type natural language to create transactions (e.g., "bought coffee 25000")
- As a user, I want the app to automatically extract amount, category, and description
- As a user, I want to confirm or edit the extracted information before saving
- As a user, I want the AI to learn my spending patterns over time

## Requirements
- Natural language processing for transaction input
- Ability to extract amount, category, and description from text
- Suggestion system for categories based on transaction text
- Confirmation step before saving extracted data
- Support for Indonesian language spending descriptions

## Technical Implementation
- Create NLP parser to extract amount, description, and potential category
- Implement regex patterns for common Indonesian transaction patterns
- Use AI/machine learning model to improve categorization over time
- Create a confirmation UI showing extracted data for user review
- Store transaction patterns to improve future suggestions

## Common Indonesian Transaction Patterns to Support
- "makan nasi gudeg 25000" → Category: Food, Amount: 25000, Description: nasi gudeg
- "isi pulsa 50000" → Category: Utilities, Amount: 50000, Description: pulsa
- "beli buku 125000" → Category: Shopping, Amount: 125000, Description: buku

## UI/UX Considerations
- Add a text input field in the transaction form
- Show extracted information in a clear, confirmable format
- Allow easy editing of extracted data
- Provide feedback when AI cannot parse the text
- Support both Bahasa Indonesia and English inputs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can enter natural language transaction descriptions
- [ ] System correctly parses amount from the text
- [ ] System suggests appropriate category based on description
- [ ] User can confirm or edit extracted information
- [ ] Transaction is created with the parsed information
- [ ] System handles common Indonesian spending patterns
- [ ] Error handling when text cannot be parsed

## Potential Implementation Approaches
1. Rule-based extraction using regex patterns
2. Simple machine learning model trained on Indonesian spending patterns
3. Integration with external NLP services (with privacy considerations)
4. Hybrid approach combining rules with ML for better accuracy

## Privacy Considerations
- Process text input locally when possible
- Be transparent about how transaction data is used for improvements
- Allow users to disable AI learning features
