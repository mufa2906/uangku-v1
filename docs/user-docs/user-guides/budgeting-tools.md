# User Guide: Budgeting Tools

## Introduction
Welcome to the Uangku Budgeting Tools! This feature helps you take control of your finances by setting spending limits and tracking your progress. Unlike simple budgeting apps, Uangku offers both traditional category-based budgets and flexible custom budgets for your unique financial goals.

## Types of Budgets

### 1. Category-Based Budgets
Link budgets directly to your existing expense categories like "Groceries", "Transportation", or "Entertainment". Perfect for controlling spending in specific areas.

### 2. Custom Named Budgets
Create budgets for broader goals like "Vacation Fund", "Emergency Savings", or "Holiday Gifts" without tying them to a single category. Great for saving toward specific objectives.

### 3. Hybrid Budgets
Combine both approaches by naming your budget and optionally linking it to a category for maximum flexibility.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Budget
1. Navigate to the "Budgets" tab in the app
2. Tap the "+" button to create a new budget
3. Choose between:
   - **Category Budget**: Select an existing category to limit spending
   - **Custom Budget**: Enter a name like "Travel Fund" for goal-based budgeting
4. Set your budget amount and period (weekly, monthly, yearly)
5. Save your budget

### Setting Budget Amounts
- Use historical spending data to inform realistic budget amounts
- Start with conservative estimates and adjust as you learn your patterns
- Consider using the 50/30/20 rule as a starting point:
  - 50% for needs (rent, groceries, utilities)
  - 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
  - 20% for savings and debt repayment

## Budget Management

### Viewing Your Budgets
- **Dashboard**: See all active budgets with progress bars
- **Budgets Page**: Detailed view of all budgets with spending history
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green: Under budget (good!)
  - Yellow: Approaching limit (time to be careful)
  - Red: Over budget (review your spending)

### Editing Budgets
1. Go to the Budgets page
2. Find the budget you want to modify
3. Tap the edit (pencil) icon
4. Update any fields as needed
5. Save your changes

### Deleting Budgets

3. Tap the trash can icon
4. Confirm deletion

## Budgeting Strategies

### Monthly Budgeting (Recommended)
Set monthly budgets to match your pay cycle. This is the most common and easiest approach for most users.

### Weekly Budgeting
Perfect for those who want more frequent checkpoints or receive income weekly.

### Yearly Budgeting
Ideal for annual expenses like insurance premiums or holiday spending that you want to budget for throughout the year.

## Budgeting Methodologies

### 1. The 50/30/20 Rule
Divide your after-tax income into three categories:
- **50% Needs**: Rent, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments
- **30% Wants**: Entertainment, dining out, hobbies
- **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, retirement, other savings goals

### 2. Zero-Based Budgeting
Assign every dollar a job:
1. Start with your total monthly income
2. Subtract all expenses, savings, and debt payments
3. The remainder should equal zero
4. Adjust categories as needed to reach zero

### 3. Goal-Based Budgeting
Set specific budgets for financial goals:
- "Vacation Fund" for upcoming trips
- "Home Down Payment" for future purchases
- "Emergency Savings" for unexpected expenses

## Tips for Success

### Start Small
Begin with 2-3 key categories like "Groceries", "Transportation", and "Entertainment" rather than trying to budget everything at once.

### Be Realistic
Set achievable budget amounts based on your actual spending patterns, not ideal scenarios.

### Review Regularly
Check your budget progress weekly and adjust amounts as you learn more about your spending habits.

### Celebrate Wins
Acknowledge when you stay under budget in categories that are important to you.

## Troubleshooting

### Why Isn't My Budget Updating?
Budgets update based on transactions within the set period. Make sure:
- Transactions are categorized correctly
- Transaction dates fall within the budget period
- The budget is marked as "Active"

### How Are Budget Amounts Calculated?
Budget spending is calculated by:
1. Identifying all transactions linked to the budget category (or all transactions for custom budgets)
2. Summing expenses within the budget period
3. Comparing to the budgeted amount

### What Happens When I Delete a Category?
If you delete a category that has a linked budget:
- The budget will no longer calculate spending for that category
- Historical budget data remains intact
- You can re-link to another category or convert to a custom budget

## Advanced Features

### Custom Budget Names
Give your budgets memorable names like:
- "Bali Trip 2025"
- "New Laptop Fund"
- "Emergency Savings"
- "Kids' Education"

### Budget Descriptions
Add context to your budgets:
- "Monthly grocery allowance for family of four"
- "Saving for emergency fund - goal: 6 months expenses"
- "Annual vacation budget for family trips"

### Flexible Periods
Adjust budget periods to match your goals:
- Weekly for discretionary spending
- Monthly for regular bills
- Yearly for irregular expenses

## Privacy & Security
- All budget data is stored securely in your private account
- Only you can see your budget information
- Budget data never leaves your device without encryption
- Deleted budgets are permanently removed after 30 days
