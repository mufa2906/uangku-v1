## Transaction Processing

### AI Parsing Process
1. **Text Analysis**: The system analyzes your input for keywords and amounts with improved pattern recognition
2. **Category Matching**: Matches description to your existing categories with enhanced Indonesian language support
3. **Amount Extraction**: Identifies numerical values as transaction amounts with better accuracy (no more partial number detection)
4. **Description Preservation**: Preserves meaningful words in descriptions (e.g., "nasi" in "makan nasi gudeg")
5. **Form Population**: Automatically fills transaction form fields with parsed information
6. **User Review**: You review and confirm the parsed information

### Verification Steps
After AI processing:
1. Check the **amount** field for accuracy
2. Review the **category** selection (may default if not recognized)
3. Verify the **description** matches your input
4. Adjust the **date** if needed
5. Select appropriate **wallet** and **budget** if applicable
6. Add any additional **notes** if necessary

## Best Practices

### Optimal Input Format
- Use clear, simple language
- Include the amount in numbers (not spelled out)
- Mention the transaction type if relevant (expense or income)
- Use consistent terminology for better learning

### Improving Accuracy
- Use transaction patterns you've used before
- Be specific with merchant/service names
- Use Indonesian terms for Indonesian transactions
- The system gets better with more usage
- Include full descriptions (e.g., "makan nasi gudeg" instead of just "makan gudeg")
- Place amounts at the end of your phrases for better recognition
- Use common transaction verbs (makan, beli, isi, transport) for better categorization

### When to Use Standard Input
- For complex transactions with multiple components
- When the AI doesn't recognize your input
- For initial setup until you get familiar with patterns
- For transactions with unusual categories

## Learning & Improvement

### Pattern Recognition
The AI system learns from your transaction history:
- Repeated patterns improve future suggestions
- Common categories are recognized faster
- Personal terminology is remembered
- Regular inputs become more accurate over time

### Teaching the System
- Use the system regularly for better learning
- Correct any misidentified transactions to improve future accuracy
- Use consistent terms for similar transactions
- The system adapts to your personal transaction language

## Privacy & Security
- Transaction text input is processed securely
- Your transaction patterns are stored privately in your account
- No personal transaction data is shared with external services
- AI processing occurs within the Uangku application environment
- All financial data remains encrypted and secure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Amount Not Detected**: Ensure numbers are in standard format (e.g., 25000 not "dua puluh lima ribu")
- **Wrong Category**: Manually select the correct category from the dropdown
- **No Recognition**: Switch back to standard input form for manual entry
- **Partial Recognition**: Complete the missing information manually

### Getting Better Results
- Use simple, clear language
